# Project-UEID

## Description
This repository contains the project work for my HND UEID (User Experience & Interface Design) module. The project focuses on designing user interfaces and optimizing user experience for a specific application or system.

## Introduction
In this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of user experience principles and interface design concepts through practical application. The project will involve designing intuitive interfaces, conducting user research, creating wireframes and prototypes, and implementing user feedback to refine the user experience.
